## Optimal Substructure

A problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

## Overlapping Subproblems

a problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than always generating new subproblems.

## Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
